\chapter{Conclusions}

This work provided an introduction to the inner workings of a particular ICN 
approach via experimentation with CCN's open source implementation Project 
CCNx.\vertbreak

We have tested CCNx by mounting and running several experiments over a simple 
testbed of constrained devices (low CPU power and memory capabilities). We 
verify that a direct application of CCNx to such device types is not feasible, 
considering the test cases presented here.\vertbreak

As future work, since Web Caches and CCNx both at rather high layers of the 
network stack (implementing a similar functionality) it could be interesting to 
compare the performance of CCNx against the use of intermediate Web Caches. 
Tests with a modified version of the \verb+ccnchat+ application may prove 
useful for evaluating exchange patterns with small and sporadic messages, the 
scenario often found in M2M, WSNs or VANETS.\vertbreak

The results and insights provided by this work can prove useful for alterations 
of CCNx at both conceptual (e.g. alternatives to the transport mechanisms 
provided by \verb+ccncatchunks2+) and implementation (e.g. throughput limits 
imposed by \verb+ccnsendchunks+) levels, specially when regarding the 
application of CCNx to applications using constrained devices.
