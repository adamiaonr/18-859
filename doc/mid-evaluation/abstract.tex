\begin{abstract}
The goals of this work are (1) to understand the bascis on the research field of 
ICN, (2) acquire ‘hands-on’ experience with a particular ICN
architecture through Project CCNx, an implementation of
the Content Centric Networking (CCN) approach, and (3) understanding the 
differences in network performance between CCNx and currently used IP-based 
approaches, by varying several testbed parameters (e.g. use of different 
applications, specific CCNx parameters, use of unicast/multicast addressing, 
etc.).\vertbreak
