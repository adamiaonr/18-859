# 18-859
Adaptation of a C/C++ implementation of Named Data Networking (NDN) to run in off-the-shelf wireless routers running openWRT (openWRT code not included). 

Deployed a small testbed of Linksys WRT160NL wireless routers and conducted a evaluation of NDN features (e.g. latency reduction due to content caching). 

Course project for ECE 18-859 course @CMU.
